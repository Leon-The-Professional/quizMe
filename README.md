# QuizMe

___


This is an app created to quiz myself on some of the basics of web dev to keep concepts fresh in my mind. I am learning Web Development, and I have found that because there is so much to learn, it is easy for earlier learned material to become fuzzy. The key concepts behind this web app are based on the ideas from the book *Make it Stick* by *Peter C. Brown*. The first and foremost concept being that semi-frequent, forced recall is essential to truly and efficiently learning. The book also emphasizes switching up the order of how you test yourself, as to avoid committing concepts to memory based on repetition, which is why I have added a randomize function.

I hope to continually use this web app as I progress in the field of development. Aside from using the functionality to learn, I hope to add more languages, concepts, and quizzes while refining existing quizzes and potentially adding more features.

Many of my answers are taken directly from the [Mozilla Developer Network webpage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
