        `1.	The &lt;input@gt; HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent.`,
        "2.	The &lt;select&gt; HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options. Each &lt;option&gt; element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. ",
        "3.	The &lt;textarea&gt; HTML element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.",
        "4.	The URL that processes the form submission. This value can be overridden by a form action attribute on a &lt;button&gt;, &lt;input type=`submit`&gt;, or &lt;input type=`image`&gt; element. This attribute is ignored when method=`dialog` is set.",
        "5.	The HTTP method to submit the form with. Possible (case insensitive) values: post: The POST method; form data sent as the request body. get: The GET method; form data appended to the action URL with a ? separator. Use this method when the form has no side-effects. dialog: When the form is inside a &lt;dialog&gt;, closes the dialog and throws a submit event on submission without submitting data or clearing the form.",

        `16. What does the <strong>order</strong> property do in flexbox?`,
    ],
    answers: [
        `1.	Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. `,
        `2.	Set display: flex on a parent container. Child elements within that container become flex items.`,
        `3.	The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed). Row is the default direction, and the other three directional options are row-reverse, column, column-reverse.`,
        `4.	The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked. nowrap is the default quality, the other two options are wrap or wrap-reverse.`,
        `5.	The flex-grow CSS property sets the flex grow factor of a flex item's main size. This property specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item (the flex grow factor). Unitless values (numbers) are used.`,
        `6.	The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink. In use, flex-shrink is used alongside the other flex properties flex-grow and flex-basis. Unitless values (numbers) are used.`,
        `7.	The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial main size of a flex item. It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing. Values with unit measurements to set width (or height if direction is set to column) or auto.`,
        `8.	The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container. In a row the main axis runs horizontal, in a column the main axis vertical. The justify-content property applies along the main axis when used with flexbox, but since stretching in the main axis is controlled by flex, stretch behaves as flex-start.`,
        `9.	The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. In a row the cross axis runs vertical, in a column the cross axis runs horizontal. The default value of align-items is stretch.`,
        `10. The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis. In a row the cross axis runs vertical, in a column the cross axis runs horizontal. The default value of align-content is stretch.`,
        `11. align-content This property works only when the 'flex-wrap:' property is set to wrap and will have no effect when the number of flex-lines is 1, where align-items will work regardless of the 'flex-wrap:' property setting and does not depend on the number of flex-lines. align-content aligns flex-lines where align-items aligns flex-items. align-content can take 6 values (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch) and align-items can take 5 (flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch. Answer credit: <a href:'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-align-content-and-align-items/'>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-align-content-and-align-items/.</a>`,
        `12. start, end, flex-start, center, left, right, normal, baseline (first baseline last baseline), space-between, space-around, space-evenly, stretch, safe, unsafe`,
        `13. The align-self CSS property overrides a flex item's (the child of a parent with display set to flex) align-items value. In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.`,
        `14. A shorthand CSS property can be used to set both the flex - direction and flex - wrap(in that order).`,
        `15. The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item(specified on the flex - item) will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container.A single unitless value(number) will denote flex - grow and flex - basis is then equal to 0. A single value with specified width/ height will dente flex-basis.If there is ever a second unitless value, it will denote flex shrink.When writing shorthand for all three properties, it must go in the order of flex - grow, flex - shrink, flex - basis.`,
        `16. The order property can be set on flex - items to change the layout order without affecting the source material.`,

        `9.	How can you test for multiple queries to apply the same styles? Provide an example.`,
        `10. What does the keyword <strong>not</strong> do?`
    ],
    answers: [
        `1.	Media queries let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters. Media queries are a key component of responsive design`,
        `2.	The @media at-rule is used to conditionally apply part of a style sheet based on the result of a media query. The @import is used to conditionally apply an entire style sheet.`,
        `3.	@import then a string or url representing the location of the resource to import, followed by a media query condition. If using multiple conditions use commas to separate the list. examples: @import url("fineprint.css") print; @import url("bluish.css") speech; @import "common.css" screen; @import url('landscape.css') screen and (orientation:landscape); `,
        `4.	A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number of media feature expressions, which may optionally be combined in various ways using logical operators. Media queries are case-insensitive.`,
        `5.	Media types describe the general category of a given device. Although websites are commonly designed with screens in mind, you may want to create styles that target special devices such as printers or audio-based screenreaders. all, print, screen, speech. Typed after the query such as @media screen or @media screen, print for multiple media types.`,
        `6.	Media features describe the specific characteristics of a given user agent, output device, or environment. For instance, you can apply specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or to devices that are being used in low-light conditions. Media features are specified within parenthesis such as @media (hover: hover) { ... }.`,
        `7.	Minimum condition or maximum condition constraints. An @media (max-width: 5000px) { ... } query would apply styles only if your browser’s viewport width is equal to or narrower than 5000px. `,
        `8.	The <em>and</em> keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features. @media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { ... } would apply to screens that are 30em in width or smaller and with an orientation of landscape.`,
        `9.	You can use a comma-separated list to apply styles when the user's device matches any one of various media types, features, or states. @media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) { ... }.`,
        `10. The not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query. It will only negate the specific media query it is applied to. (Thus, it will not apply to every media query in a comma-separated list of media queries.) The not keyword can't be used to negate an individual feature query, only an entire media query. `

    answers: [
        `1.	The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects. Items in an array are contained by square brackets [ ] and items in an array are separated by commas. let fruit = [‘apple’, ‘orange’, ‘lemon’];`,
        `2.	Specify an array, then in square brackets specify the desired index number. The first index number of an array is 0. Using the array let fruit = [‘apple’, ‘orange’, ‘lemon’] fruit[0] would = ‘apple’`,
        `3.	The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. Yes it is destructive.`,
        `4.	The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array. Yes it is destructive.`,
        `5.	The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. Yes it is destructive.`,
        `6.	The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. Yes it is destructive.`,
        `7.	Destructuring an array is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays (or properties from obejects) into distinct variables. You can destructure more than one array at once, the syntax is square brackets containing the new names of the array items as variables, followed by an equal sign and then either the name of the array or an actual array to draw values from. Array values are destructured in order. [a, b] = [10, 20] which would make a = 10 and b = 20. If let Arr = [10, 20] then [a, b] = Arr would also make a = 10 and b = 20.`,
        `8.	When using the rest syntax while destructuring an array, the remainder of items in an array will be assigned to whatever variable name is specified after the rest syntax. Ex. [a, b, …rest] = [10, 20, 30,40] rest would equal a new array of [30, 40]. Note the name ‘rest’ can be anything.`,
        `9.	The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array. No it is not destructive.`,
        `10.	The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator. This is not destructive. Examples: .join(‘’) .join(‘-‘) .join(‘ ‘)`,
        `11.	The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate. No it is not destructive.`,
        `12.	The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first. Yes it is destructive.`,
        `13.	The indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. No it is not destructive.`,
        `14.	The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. If no second number is listed then only the items up to the specified first parameter are removed and the rest remain. No it is not destructive. example .slice(2) .slice(5, 9)`,
        `15.	 The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. There are 3 possible parameters in this array. The first refers to the index location to start, the second argument refers to the number of array objects to be removed, and the third is (optionally) what can be inserted instead. Yes, it is destructive.`,
        `16.	Yes`,
        `17.	The reference. If they are referencing the same array they are true, but if they are two different arrays containing the same values, they would return false.`,
        `18.	The contents of the array can be changed and manipulated freely but completely redefining the array is not allowed.`,
        `19.	 The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. example .map( x => x * 2).  No, it is not destructive.`,
        `20.	The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. example .filter(word => word.length > 6). No it is not destructive.`,
        `21.	The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. example .some((element) => element % 2 === 0) No, it is not destructive.`,
        `22.	The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value. example .every((element) => element % 2 === 0) No it is not destructive.`,
        `23.	The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values. Yes, it is destructive. To implement a compare function there must be two parameters provided in the function (a, b). If using values other than numbers there must be logical operators inside the function being called that return 1, -1, or 0 to sort the elements. If using numbers the following conditions will sort the elements 
a.	If compareFunction (a, b) returns a value > than 0, sort be before a
b.	if compareFunction (a, b) returns a value < or = to 0 leave a and b in the same order.`,
        `24.	The reduce() method executes a user-supplied “reducer” callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value. The initial value is optional and will default to the first value of the array if not included. example .reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {function to execute. Include return}, initial value). No, it is not destructive.`

    ],
    answers: [
        `1.	An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand, for example, x = y assigns the value of y to x.`,
        `2.	=`,
        `3.	x += y`,
        `4.	x -= y`,
        `5.	x *= y`,
        `6.	x /= y`,
        `7.	x %= y. `,
        `8.	X **= y. `,
        `9.	A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. Operands can be numerical, string, logical or object values. If two operands are of a different type Javascript will try to compare them numerically unless the strict equality operators are used.`,
        `10. == returns true if the operands are equal (this CO will attempt to convert two different operand types numerically if they are not the same, so ‘1’ and 1 would return true)`,
        `11. != returns true if the operands are NOT equal (this CO will attempt to convert two different operand types numerically if they are not the same, so ‘1’ and 1 would return false)?`,
        `12. === returns true if the operands are of the same type and equal.`,
        `13. !== returns true if the operands are of the same type but NOT equal.`,
        `14. > returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.`,
        `15. >= returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.`,
        `16. < returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.`,
        `17. <= returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.`,
        `18. The modulate operator (%) returns the integer remainder of a division. For example, 17 % 5 = 2 because the remainder of 17 divided by 5 is 2. 4 % 2 would = 0 because there is no remainder.`,
        `19. The exponentiation operator (**) returns the result of raising the first operand to the power of the second operand. 2 ** 3 = 8`,
        `20. The increment operator (++) increments (adds one to) its operand and returns a value. If the operator is before a number it will add 1 before returning the value, if it is after the operator it will return the value before adding 1.`,
        `21. The decrement operator (--) decrements (subtracts one from) its operand and returns a value. If the operator is before a number it will subtract 1 before returning the value, if it is after the operator it will return the value before subtracting 1.`,
        `22. The unary plus operator (+) precedes its operand and evaluates to its operand but attempts to convert it into a number, if it isn't already. +’1’ would = 1. const y = -1 +y would = -1.`,
        `23. Logical Operators are typically used to return a Boolean value based on the outcome of the expressions used in the logical operators.`,
        `24. The logical AND (&&) operator (logical conjunction) for a set of Boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true. Otherwise it will be false. `,
        `25. The logical OR (||) operator (logical disjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value. However, the || operator actually returns the value of one of the specified operands, so if this operator is used with non-Boolean values, it will return a non-Boolean value.`,
        `26.	The logical NOT (!) operator (logical complement, negation) takes truth to falsity and vice versa. It is typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When used with non-Boolean values, it returns false if its single operand can be converted to true; otherwise, returns true.`,
        `27.	The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement. example: condition ? val1 : val2  where val1 returns if true and val2 returns if false. For example: if age = 17 then the ternary operator <em>age >=18 ? ‘adult’: ‘minor”</em> would return minor.`,
